TO SHOW UPLOADED IMAGES

export async function GET( NextRequest/Request, params) {

    ... do processing, parse your routes
    
    ... write/read files to/from a data folder you created 
        (i.e. /data/stuff)

    ... read your files from /data/stuff to a buffer (i.e., imgBuffer)

    return new NextResponse(
        imgBuffer,
            {
                status: 200,
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "image/png",
                }
            }
        )
}


Then:
<Image src='/my/route/img.png', .../>
